Welcome to our Amazon Products Data Analysis project!  
In this project, we dive deep into an Amazon products dataset to explore **pricing strategies**, **discount impacts**, **customer ratings**, and **review patterns**.  
Using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Streamlit**, we transformed raw data into actionable insights and built an **interactive dashboard** to visualize the findings.

##  What We Did
- Loaded and cleaned the Amazon product dataset.
- Handled missing or incorrect data types.
- Conducted **price analysis**, **discount analysis**, and **rating review analysis**.
- Detected **outliers** and **anomalies** in product performance.
- Created **interactive dashboards** using Streamlit to display KPIs and visualizations.

##  Summary of Findings

### 1.  Price Analysis

- Significant discounts available on several products, up to **65% off**.

### 2.  Discounts
- Discounts range between **46%** and **70%**.
- Heavily discounted products may drive higher sales volume.

### 3.  Ratings and Reviews

- Products with more reviews often had better average ratings.

### 4. Categories
- Most common categories: **Accessories & Peripherals**, **Televisions**.
- Dataset includes diverse product types from **Electronics** to **Home Theater**.

### 5. Outliers & Anomalies
- Identified high-priced, low-rated products that might need business review.
- Highlighted great-value products with low prices and high ratings.

### 6.  Product Descriptions & Reviews
- Positive reviews emphasize **value for money**.

##  Key Insights
- **Higher ratings** and **more reviews** indicate better market reception.
- **Discounts alone** don't guarantee higher customer satisfaction â€” perceived **value matters more**.
- Businesses should **analyze outliers** (like expensive but poorly rated products) to adjust strategies.
- **Product Categories:** Products from categories with a higher number of positive reviews (e.g., **Accessories & Peripherals**) tend to perform better compared to categories with mixed feedback, such as **Home & Kitchen**. 
- **Customer Behavior:** A product with a significant discount doesnâ€™t always guarantee a higher rating, suggesting that customers may still be dissatisfied with product quality, even if it is affordable.
- **Review Sentiment:** Both positive and negative reviews provide valuable insights. Positive feedback often mentions the product's reliability and value, while negative reviews indicate opportunities for improvement (e.g., performance issues, charging speeds, etc.).

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Cleaning:** One of the main challenges was dealing with missing or inconsistent data. We had to handle null values and ensure data types were consistent across columns (e.g., ensuring ratings were numerical).
  
- **Outliers Detection:** Identifying outliers required a balance between detecting genuinely poor-performing products and distinguishing them from those with genuine sales success but low ratings.

##  Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data cleaning and manipulation)
- **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting graphs)
- **Streamlit** (for building an interactive dashboard)
